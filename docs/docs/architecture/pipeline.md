# Pipeline & Optimizer

## Three-Phase Pipeline

Every Rayforce query goes through three phases:

1. **Build** — Construct a lazy DAG of operations using the C API or Rayfall `select`/`update` builtins. No data is processed at this stage.
2. **Optimize** — Transform the DAG through multiple optimization passes that rewrite, reorder, and fuse operations.
3. **Execute** — Walk the optimized DAG and process data in 1024-element morsels. Element-wise subtrees are compiled to flat bytecode at execution time and evaluated over per-worker scratch buffers without intermediate materialization.

```c
/* Phase 1: Build the DAG (lazy, no data movement) */
ray_graph_t* g    = ray_graph_new(table);
ray_op_t*    x    = ray_scan(g, "x");
ray_op_t*    y    = ray_scan(g, "y");
ray_op_t*    sum  = ray_add(g, x, y);
ray_op_t*    pred = ray_gt(g, sum, ray_const_i64(g, 100));
ray_op_t*    filt = ray_filter(g, sum, pred);

/* Phase 2 + 3: Optimize and execute (called internally) */
ray_t* result = ray_execute(g, filt);

ray_graph_free(g);
```

## DAG Node Structure

### ray_op_t — Base Node (32 bytes)

Every operation in the DAG is represented by a 32-byte `ray_op_t` that fits in a single cache line:

```c
typedef struct ray_op {
    uint16_t       opcode;     /* OP_ADD, OP_SCAN, OP_FILTER, etc.  */
    uint8_t        arity;      /* 0, 1, or 2                        */
    uint8_t        flags;      /* OP_FLAG_DEAD                      */
    int8_t         out_type;   /* inferred output type               */
    uint8_t        pad[3];
    uint32_t       id;         /* unique node ID                    */
    uint32_t       est_rows;   /* estimated row count                */
    struct ray_op*  inputs[2];  /* NULL if unused                    */
} ray_op_t;
```

Key design decisions:

- **32-byte alignment** — nodes are allocated from a contiguous array in the `ray_graph_t`, keeping the DAG hot in L1 cache during optimization walks.
- **At most 2 inputs** — binary operations use both; unary ops use `inputs[0]` only; sources have both NULL.
- **Flags** — `OP_FLAG_DEAD` marks nodes removed by DCE.
- **est_rows** — populated by the type inference pass and used by filter reorder and join planning.

### ray_op_ext_t — Extended Node

Operations that need more state (GROUP, SORT, JOIN, WINDOW, PIVOT, and all graph ops) use an extended node that embeds `ray_op_t` as its first field, followed by a union of operation-specific data:

- **GROUP**: key columns, aggregation ops and inputs, key/agg counts
- **SORT**: column array, descending flags, nulls-first flags
- **JOIN**: left/right key columns, join type (inner/left/full)
- **WINDOW**: partition keys, order keys, function kinds, frame specification
- **PIVOT**: index columns, pivot column, value column, aggregation op
- **Graph ops**: relationship pointer, SIP selection bitmap, direction, depth limits, damping factor, weight column, coordinate columns
- **WCO**: relationship array, variable count
- **Vector similarity**: query vector, dimension, k, ef_search (HNSW)

### ray_graph_t — Operation Graph

```c
typedef struct ray_graph {
    ray_op_t*       nodes;       /* contiguous array of op nodes       */
    uint32_t       node_count;  /* number of nodes                   */
    uint32_t       node_cap;    /* allocated capacity                */
    ray_t*          table;       /* bound table (column source)       */
    ray_t**         tables;      /* multi-table registry               */
    uint16_t       n_tables;    /* number of registered tables        */
    ray_op_ext_t**  ext_nodes;   /* tracked extended nodes for cleanup */
    uint32_t       ext_count;
    uint32_t       ext_cap;
    ray_t*          selection;   /* RAY_SEL bitmap (lazy filter)       */
} ray_graph_t;
```

## Optimizer Passes

The optimizer runs multiple passes in a fixed order. Each pass walks the DAG and rewrites it in-place.

### 1. Type Inference

Bottom-up pass that propagates types from leaf nodes (SCAN, CONST) through the DAG. Determines the `out_type` of every node and populates `est_rows` estimates. This information drives all subsequent passes.

### 2. Constant Folding

Evaluates operations on constant inputs at optimization time. For example, `ray_add(const(2), const(3))` is replaced with `const(5)`. Applies to all element-wise arithmetic, comparisons, and logical operations.

### 3. Idiom Rewrite

Recognizes high-level expression patterns and rewrites them to more efficient equivalents before later passes run. For example, `count(distinct col)` is rewritten to use a dedicated HLL-backed distinct-count aggregate node. Because this pass may replace the root, it runs before predicate pushdown and SIP.

### 4. Sideways Information Passing (SIP)

Propagates selection bitmaps backward through `OP_EXPAND` chains. When a filter follows a graph expansion, SIP creates a `RAY_SEL` bitmap on the source side that allows the executor to skip source nodes whose neighbors would all fail the downstream filter. See [SIP Optimization](../graph/algorithms.md#sip) for details.

### 5. Factorize

Marks multi-hop graph expansions for factorized execution. Sets the `factorized` flag on EXPAND/VAR_EXPAND nodes, enabling output as `ray_fvec_t` / `ray_ftable_t` instead of flat vectors. Avoids cross-product materialization in multi-join graph patterns.

### 6. Predicate Pushdown

Pushes `OP_FILTER` nodes closer to data sources by walking the DAG up to four times until no further rewrites are possible. The pass has three arms:

**SELECT/ALIAS arm.** A filter above a `SELECT` or `ALIAS` node is swapped below it — `FILTER(pred, SELECT(x))` becomes `SELECT(FILTER(pred, x))` — provided the `SELECT`/`ALIAS` node has only a single consumer (a multi-consumer rewrite would corrupt shared branches).

**GROUP arm.** A HAVING-style filter above a `GROUP` node is pushed below the group when every scan referenced by the predicate maps to a plain `OP_SCAN` group-key column (same symbol name, not an aggregate output). Because every row in a group shares its key value, a row passes the HAVING predicate if and only if the original source row passes the equivalent filter, making the rewrite semantics-preserving. Predicates that reference aggregate outputs (`v_sum`, `v_count`, etc.) match no key and remain above the group as true HAVING filters. The GROUP arm also refuses to push into factorized-expand pipelines (detected by a `_src` key scan). At execution time the executor runs the interposed pushed filter through the same selection bitmap it already honors for every `OP_GROUP` dispatch. At most one filter is pushed per group; a second chained HAVING predicate stays above.

**EXPAND arm.** A filter above an `OP_EXPAND` node is pushed to the expand's source input when all scans in the predicate are reachable from that source subtree, reducing source rows before the graph traversal. The single-consumer guard applies here too.

### 7. Filter Reorder

When multiple filter predicates are chained, reorders them by estimated selectivity (most selective first). Uses the `est_rows` from type inference to estimate selectivity. More selective filters run first, reducing the number of rows processed by subsequent filters.

### 8. Projection Pushdown

Identifies which columns are actually needed by the query and pushes projection below joins and group-by operations. Columns that are never referenced after a certain point are dropped early, reducing memory bandwidth and intermediate result sizes.

### 9. Partition Pruning

For partitioned tables, analyzes filter predicates to determine which partitions can be skipped entirely. A predicate like `date > '2024-01-01'` on a date-partitioned table eliminates all partition directories before that date without scanning them. The pruning pass produces a `seg_mask` bitmap that the executor uses during [block offloading](offloading.md) to skip pruned segments entirely.

### 10. Dead Code Elimination (DCE)

Removes nodes marked `OP_FLAG_DEAD` that have no live consumers. Cleans up the DAG after all other passes.

## Morsel-Driven Execution

### Morsel Processing

All vector processing in Rayforce is chunked into **morsels** of 1024 elements (`RAY_MORSEL_ELEMS`). This constant is tuned to fit in L1 cache across all supported architectures.

```c
typedef struct {
    ray_t*    vec;          /* source vector                     */
    int64_t  offset;       /* current position (element index)  */
    int64_t  len;          /* total length of vector            */
    uint32_t elem_size;    /* bytes per element                 */
    int64_t  morsel_len;   /* elements in current morsel        */
    void*    morsel_ptr;   /* pointer to current morsel data    */
    uint8_t* null_bits;    /* current morsel null bitmap        */
} ray_morsel_t;
```

The morsel iterator API:

```c
ray_morsel_init(&m, vec);             /* initialize iterator       */
while (ray_morsel_next(&m)) {         /* advance to next morsel    */
    /* process m.morsel_ptr[0..m.morsel_len) */
}
```

### Expression Compilation (Fused Execution)

Element-wise operation subtrees are compiled to flat bytecode at **execution time** — not as an optimizer pass. The executor (`exec.c`) calls `expr_compile()` for every element-wise subtree it encounters; the group executor (`group.c`) additionally calls it for aggregate input expressions.

`expr_compile` walks the DAG rooted at a node and emits a flat instruction sequence:

- **Registers**: up to 16 slots (`EXPR_MAX_REGS`), each holding a typed lane — `REG_SCAN` (column slice), `REG_CONST` (broadcast scalar), or `REG_SCRATCH` (computed intermediate).
- **Instructions**: up to 48 opcodes (`EXPR_MAX_INS`) covering arithmetic, comparisons, casts, and logical operations.
- **Morsel evaluation**: the compiled program is evaluated one morsel at a time (1024 rows) in per-worker, arena-allocated scratch buffers. No full-length intermediate vectors are materialized.
- **Parallelism**: subtrees covering ≥ 65,536 rows (`RAY_PARALLEL_THRESHOLD`) are dispatched across worker threads, each thread processing its own morsel slice independently.
- **Parted-segment aware**: for partitioned tables, column pointers are rebound per segment at evaluation time — zero-copy, no gather.

**Null handling.** Nullable integer columns are sentinel-normalized at morsel load: `NULL_I32`/`NULL_I16` are widened to `NULL_I64` in `i64` lanes, or to `NaN` in `f64` lanes. Per-instruction null-aware kernel variants are selected at compile time (sentinel-checking `i64` arithmetic and comparisons, sentinel-mapping casts). F64 `NaN`-nulls propagate through arithmetic natively. Output vectors carry `RAY_ATTR_HAS_NULLS` conservatively. Null-free programs compile to the identical instruction stream as non-nullable inputs — no null checks on the fast path.

!!! note "Fallback conditions"
    `expr_compile` bails to recursive per-op evaluation when: the column type is `RAY_STR`, the column carries `RAY_ATTR_SLICE`, the column is `MAPCOMMON` or a `FILE`-domain `SYM`, the constant is a null literal, a scalar-broadcast length would mismatch, register or instruction limits are exceeded (> 16 regs / > 48 instructions), the traversal stack depth exceeds 64, the graph has > 4096 nodes, a nullable program hits an instruction without a null-aware kernel variant (e.g. `F64 AND/OR/NOT`), or the operation is `OP_IDIV`.

## Selection Bitmaps

Filters in Rayforce produce `RAY_SEL` bitmaps instead of materializing filtered vectors. A selection bitmap is a compact bit-vector with per-morsel metadata that enables three-tier processing:

| Segment Flag | Meaning | Processing |
|---|---|---|
| `RAY_SEL_NONE (0)` | All bits zero | Skip entire morsel — zero cost |
| `RAY_SEL_ALL (1)` | All bits one | Process without bitmap check |
| `RAY_SEL_MIX (2)` | Mixed bits | Check per-row bitmap |

The selection bitmap layout in memory:

```c
/* RAY_SEL block layout (at ray_data offset 0): */
ray_sel_meta_t  meta;          /* total_pass, n_segs (16 bytes) */
uint8_t        seg_flags[];   /* NONE/ALL/MIX per morsel       */
uint16_t       seg_popcnt[];  /* passing row count per morsel   */
uint64_t       bits[];        /* 1024 rows / 64 bits = 16 words per morsel */
```

This three-tier scheme means that fully-passing or fully-failing morsels (which are common in practice) incur no per-row overhead. Only the `MIX` segments require bitmap checking.

## Parallelism

### Thread Pool

Rayforce uses a global thread pool (`ray_pool_t`) for parallel execution. Queries with more than `RAY_PARALLEL_THRESHOLD` (64 * 1024 = 65,536) elements are dispatched across worker threads. Each thread processes `RAY_DISPATCH_MORSELS` (8) morsels at a time to amortize scheduling overhead.

### Radix-Partitioned Hash Join

Hash joins use adaptive radix partitioning to ensure each partition's hash table fits in L2 cache. The number of radix bits adapts between `RAY_JOIN_MIN_RADIX` (2, producing 4 partitions) and `RAY_JOIN_MAX_RADIX` (14, producing 16K partitions) based on input size, targeting a per-partition working set of `RAY_JOIN_L2_TARGET` (256 KB).

The join pipeline:

1. **Partition** — Radix-partition both inputs by hash key bits
2. **Build** — Build per-partition hash tables (each fits in L2). For inner joins, the executor selects the build side at runtime using actual materialized row counts: the smaller input becomes the build side, keeping hash tables as compact as possible. LEFT, FULL, and ANTI joins always build on the right to preserve left-row semantics. The small-input (chained) path also always builds on the right. During the per-partition open-addressing build, the executor tracks per-key duplicate counts; when a single key exceeds the duplication threshold (`RADIX_DUP_RUN_MAX = 512`), it abandons the radix attempt and re-runs the whole join through the chained hash table, which is O(n) regardless of duplication. No join (INNER, LEFT, or FULL) can degrade to quadratic build cost on a skewed key.
3. **Probe** — Probe partitions in parallel across worker threads. Inner-join output order is partition- and thread-dependent; it is not guaranteed to be stable.

### Per-Thread Heaps

Each worker thread has its own heap (`heap_id` in the pool header). Vectors allocated during parallel execution are tagged with their owning heap via the pool they reside in. Cross-heap frees are deferred to a lock-free LIFO and reclaimed when the owning heap flushes. See [Memory Model](memory.md) for details.

## Full Pipeline Example

A complete example showing all three phases for a filtered aggregation query:

```c
/* Table: trades with columns price (F64), qty (I64), sym (SYM) */
ray_graph_t* g = ray_graph_new(trades);

/* Phase 1: Build DAG */
ray_op_t* price = ray_scan(g, "price");
ray_op_t* qty   = ray_scan(g, "qty");
ray_op_t* sym   = ray_scan(g, "sym");

/* Compute notional = price * qty */
ray_op_t* notional = ray_mul(g, price, qty);

/* Filter: price > 50.0 */
ray_op_t* pred = ray_gt(g, price, ray_const_f64(g, 50.0));
ray_op_t* filt = ray_filter(g, notional, pred);

/* Group by sym, sum notional */
ray_op_t* keys[] = {sym};
uint16_t agg_ops[] = {OP_SUM};
ray_op_t* agg_ins[] = {filt};
ray_op_t* grouped = ray_group(g, keys, 1, agg_ops, agg_ins, 1);

/* Phase 2+3: Optimize and execute */
ray_t* result = ray_execute(g, grouped);

/*
 * What the optimizer does:
 *  1. Type inference: price=F64, qty=I64, notional=F64, pred=BOOL
 *  2. Constant folding: const 50.0 stays (already constant)
 *  3. Predicate pushdown: filter moves below the multiply
 *  4. DCE: removes any dead intermediate nodes
 *  At execution time, expr_compile fuses SCAN(price) -> GT(const) into
 *  a single flat bytecode pass over each 1024-row morsel.
 */

ray_graph_free(g);
```
