# Accelerator Indexes

Per-column accelerator structures — `zone`, `hash`, `sort`, `bloom` — attached directly to numeric vectors.  Build once at user request; survive copy / refcount semantics; ride alongside the column through the pipeline.

!!! note "v1 status"
    The four index kinds, their build kernels, and the `(.idx.*)` Rayfall surface are shipped.  The executor consults indexes at six sites: filter comparisons, filter IN, ORDER BY, distinct, and find.  See the [routing table](#routing-table) below.

This page is the **reference** for the `.idx.*` family. For the broader index landscape (HNSW, linked columns, partition pruning, CSR), see [Indexes Overview](indexes-overview.md). For decision walk-throughs and worked workflows, see the [Indexes Guide](../guides/indexes.md).

## Routing Table

The executor consults indexes at six sites.  Each site has a specific consumption point, eligibility contract, and fallback guarantee — results never differ from the scan path (verified by drop-differential tests in `test/rfl/ops/idx_route.rfl`).

| Index kind | Consumption site | What happens |
|---|---|---|
| `.idx.zone` | `filter` — comparison predicates (EQ/NE/LT/LE/GT/GE) | O(1) all/none short-circuit: if the constant falls outside the column's [min, max] range the filter returns 0 rows without scanning; if every row must pass the whole table is returned.  Integer and float families both supported. |
| `.idx.bloom` | `filter` — EQ on integer-family columns | Definite-absent proof: if all k probe bits are clear the key is absent and the filter returns 0 rows without scanning.  False positives fall through to the scan; there are no false absences. |
| `.idx.hash` | `filter` — EQ on integer-family columns | Direct rowsel from hash-chain probe: matching rows are collected in O(matches) without a full column scan.  Null-free columns only (HAS_NULLS → scan). |
| `.idx.sort` | `filter` — range predicates (EQ/LT/LE/GT/GE) | Binary search over the row-id permutation to identify the matching span, then a rowsel is built from that span.  NE (two disjoint spans) falls back.  A selectivity guard fires when the span exceeds n/128 (~0.78%) — see [Performance Characteristics](#performance-characteristics) for the measured rationale. |
| `.idx.hash` | `filter` — IN predicates on integer-family columns | Hash-chain probe for each set element; result is the union rowsel over all matches. |
| `.idx.sort` | ORDER BY — single ascending key | The pre-built permutation is reused directly rather than re-sorting.  Descending ORDER BY falls back to recompute (reversing the perm would swap tie-group positions relative to stable DESC sort). |
| `.idx.sort` | `distinct` | Walk the sort permutation once to collect first-occurrence row ids per distinct value — O(n) with no hash table.  SYM/GUID/STR columns fall back. |
| `.idx.hash` | `find` | Hash-chain probe returns the minimum row id matching the needle, or a provably-absent signal.  Integer-family needles only; float and cross-family needles fall through to the scan. |

### Eligibility conditions (uniform)

All six sites apply the same prechecks before consulting an index:

- **Fresh:** the index's `built_for_len` must match the column's current length (mismatch → stale → fallback).
- **No nulls (new paths):** `HAS_NULLS` set on the column → fallback for all paths except hash-EQ at the filter site, which also re-checks `HAS_NULLS` explicitly.
- **Not parted / not MAPCOMMON:** parted and MAPCOMMON columns skip routing at the filter and IN sites.
- **Default table:** filter and IN sites only route columns from the query's default table (non-default table references are skipped).

Mutation auto-drops the attached index — the in-place mutators (`(insert 'v val)`, `(alter 'v set i val)`, `(alter 'v concat vals)`) call `ray_index_drop()` before writing, so a mutated column always has `HAS_INDEX` clear afterward.  Reattach explicitly after the write.

### Fallback guarantee

Every fast path falls back to the full scan on any miss (wrong kind, stale index, selectivity guard, OOM, ineligible type, etc.).  The fallback path is exercised by the drop-differential pattern: each case in `test/rfl/ops/idx_route.rfl` is run twice — once with the index attached and once with `.idx.drop` — and the results are asserted identical.

### count(select ...) and other bypass shapes

Two count-specific fast paths (`try_count_simple_compare` and `ray_try_count_select_expr`) intercept `(count (select {where: pred}))` shapes **before** the exec-level OP_FILTER that hosts the index sites.  These count fast paths evaluate the predicate directly on the raw column without consulting the index.  To reach the indexed path, the outer expression must materialize the full table result — e.g. `(sum (at (select {from: T where: pred}) 'col))`.  ORDER BY, distinct, and find are invoked directly on the column vector and always reach the index routing layer regardless of how the result is consumed.

## Quick Pick

Match the shape of your *query*, not the shape of the data.

| Query shape | Kind | Active now |
|---|---|---|
| Constant predicate may fall outside the column's value range | `.idx.zone` | Yes — O(1) all/none short-circuit at the filter site |
| Repeated `=` / `in` / `find` | `.idx.hash` | Yes — O(matches) hash probe at filter EQ, filter IN, and find sites |
| Range queries, sorted output | `.idx.sort` | Yes — binary search at filter range site; permutation reuse at ORDER BY and distinct |
| Cheap probabilistic membership rejection | `.idx.bloom` | Yes — definite-absent proof at filter EQ site (integer-family only) |

## Why Per-Column Indexes

Rayforce's hot path is morsel-driven columnar execution — every operator scans 1024-element chunks of contiguous values.  That's already fast for full-column work, but it's still O(n) for needle-in-haystack queries: `filter (= col 42)` visits every row even when only one matches, `(in col big-set)` builds a rowsel from a full scan, `(find col k)` linear-scans.

An **accelerator index** is a precomputed data structure attached to the column itself.  The user pays the build cost once; subsequent queries against that column consult the index instead of the raw values at the applicable routing sites.

- `zone` — min/max plus null count (~32 bytes per column).  Prunes whole-column filter work when a constant predicate falls outside the range.
- `hash` — chained open-addressing table.  O(1) eq / in / find; stays useful for non-unique columns via the chain.
- `sort` — ascending row-id permutation.  Binary search for range predicates; pre-sorted ORDER BY and distinct.
- `bloom` — m-bit probabilistic membership filter (k=3 hashes).  Cheap, small, no false negatives — EQ definite-absent rejection at the filter site.

## Observability

Set `RAY_IDX_STATS=1` before running a process.  At exit, per-site consult and hit counters are printed to stderr in the form:

```
idx_route filter_zone   consults=3 hits=2
idx_route filter_bloom  consults=1 hits=1
idx_route filter_hash   consults=5 hits=5
idx_route filter_range  consults=4 hits=3
idx_route in            consults=2 hits=2
idx_route find          consults=8 hits=7
idx_route sort          consults=6 hits=6
idx_route distinct      consults=2 hits=2
```

A consult means the site attempted to use the index; a hit means the fast path succeeded and the scan was bypassed.  Consult without hit means the index was present but the guard (selectivity, eligibility, stale) rejected it.

## Constructing an Index

Each kind has a one-arg attach builtin.  Attaching is idempotent — if a different kind is already attached, it's dropped first; mutation invalidates and clears it implicitly.

### Signature

`(.idx.zone v)   (.idx.hash v)   (.idx.sort v)   (.idx.bloom v)`

Attach an index of the named kind to a numeric vector `v`.  Returns the column with the new index attached (the underlying values are unchanged).  Type errors out for non-numeric columns — `RAY_BOOL`, `RAY_U8`, `RAY_I16`, `RAY_I32`, `RAY_I64`, `RAY_F32`, `RAY_F64`, `RAY_DATE`, `RAY_TIME`, `RAY_TIMESTAMP`.  `RAY_SYM` / `RAY_STR` targets are deferred to v2.

### Examples

```lisp
(set v [5 1 9 3 7])

; Zonemap: min, max, null count.
(set vz (.idx.zone v))
(.idx.info vz)
; ⇒ {kind:zone length:5 parent_type:5 saved_attrs:0 min:1 max:9 n_nulls:0}

; Hash: chained table with the linked-list of duplicates.
(set vh (.idx.hash v))
(.idx.info vh)
; ⇒ {kind:hash length:5 parent_type:5 saved_attrs:0 capacity:16 n_keys:5}

; Sort: ascending row-id permutation.
(set vs (.idx.sort v))
(.idx.info vs)
; ⇒ {kind:sort length:5 parent_type:5 saved_attrs:0 perm_len:5}

; Bloom: m bits, k hashes, n_keys non-null rows added.
(set vb (.idx.bloom v))
(.idx.info vb)
; ⇒ {kind:bloom length:5 parent_type:5 saved_attrs:0 m_bits:64 k:3 n_keys:5}
```

Indexed columns participate in normal operations transparently.  `(sum vh)`, `(at vz 0)`, `(count vb)` all work identically to the un-indexed source.  Whatever was true of `v` — nullability, slicing, arithmetic — is true of every `vz`, `vh`, `vs`, `vb`.

## Introspection & Lifecycle

| Function | Returns | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `(.idx.has? v)` | boolean | True iff any index kind is currently attached. |
| `(.idx.info v)` | dict or null | Per-kind metadata: kind, length, parent_type, saved_attrs, plus kind-specific stats (min/max, capacity, perm_len, m_bits / k / n_keys).  Null when no index is attached. |
| `(.idx.drop v)` | v with index removed | Detaches whichever kind is attached; restores the underlying nullmap state byte-for-byte.  No-op if no index is attached. |

### Mutation Drops the Index

The Rayfall in-place mutators — `(insert 'v val)` for append and `(alter 'v set i val)` / `(alter 'v concat val)` for set / append — invalidate the attached index.  The mutator paths drop the index transparently, restore the original nullmap bytes, and proceed with the write.  Subsequent `(.idx.has?)` calls return false; reattach the index after the write if you want index routing on the updated column.

```lisp
(set v [5 1 9 3 7])
(set vz (.idx.zone v))
(.idx.has? vz)              ; ⇒ true
(alter 'vz set 0 100)
(.idx.has? vz)              ; ⇒ false
```

### Coexistence with Linked Columns

An accelerator index uses bytes 0–7 of the column's [nullmap union](https://github.com/RayforceDB/rayforce/blob/master/include/rayforce.h); a [linked column](links.md) uses bytes 8–15.  The two flags — `RAY_ATTR_HAS_INDEX = 0x08` and `RAY_ATTR_HAS_LINK = 0x04` — are independent and a column can carry both.  Dereferencing through a link still works on an indexed column; dropping the index leaves the link intact and vice versa.

## Common Workflows

### Hot column, repeated point lookups

```lisp
(set v (* 7 (til 1000)))   ; 0, 7, 14, ..., 6993
(set v (.idx.hash v))
(in 700 v)                   ; ⇒ true   (700 = 7 × 100) — hash-chain probe
(in 701 v)                   ; ⇒ false
(find v 700)                 ; ⇒ 100    — hash fast path returns minimum row id
(set v (.idx.drop v))         ; optional early release; mutators auto-drop
```

### Range scans on a stable column

```lisp
(set prices [102 98 105 101 99 103])
(set prices (.idx.sort prices))
(.idx.info prices)
; ⇒ {kind:sort length:6 parent_type:5 saved_attrs:0 perm_len:6}
```

The original column is unchanged; the sort lives in a row-id permutation alongside it.  Range queries against this column use binary search over the permutation rather than a full scan — provided the span stays within the ~0.78% selectivity threshold.

### Whole-column pruning

```lisp
(set ages [21 34 29 42 37])
(set ages (.idx.zone ages))
(.idx.info ages)
; ⇒ {kind:zone length:5 parent_type:5 saved_attrs:0 min:21 max:42 n_nulls:0}
```

A predicate like `(= ages 17)` falls outside `[21, 42]`; the executor short-circuits to 0 rows without scanning.  A predicate like `(>= ages 1)` sees every row must pass and returns the full table without scanning.

## Performance Characteristics

| Kind | Build | Space | Query cost | Selectivity guard |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `.idx.zone` | O(n) one pass | O(1) — min, max, n_nulls | O(1) range check | None — all/none only |
| `.idx.hash` | O(n) | O(n) table + chain | O(matches) average; chain-walk on collisions | None |
| `.idx.sort` | O(n log n) | O(n) row-id permutation | O(log n) binary search + O(m log m) rowsel | Span > n/128 (~0.78%) → fallback |
| `.idx.bloom` | O(n · k), k = 3 | O(m) bits, m = 64 default | O(k) probe | EQ only; integer family only |

**Sort-index selectivity guard:** the rowsel build after the binary search costs O(m log m) where m is the match count.  Measured break-even on shuffled data is 0.5–1% selectivity; the guard threshold of n/128 (~0.78%) keeps the fast path in the win region and rejects the loss region.  The guard is skipped when n < 64 (trivial case).  See `bench/bottleneck/idx_route_compare.md` ROUND 2 Q1 for the curve.

## Storage and Lifetime

An accelerator index is a child `ray_t*` of type `RAY_INDEX` whose `data[]` payload holds a `ray_index_t` struct — the kind tag, kind-specific child references (the hash table + chain vec, the sort permutation vec, the bloom bit vec), and a 16-byte snapshot of the parent's pre-attach nullmap union.  When the index is attached, the parent's nullmap union holds an owning pointer to the index ray_t.  Detach memcpy's the snapshot back; refcounting handles shared cases (a COW-shared index is cloned-on-detach so neither holder's view breaks).

This design has three useful properties:

- **Free for non-indexed columns.**  Vectors without `RAY_ATTR_HAS_INDEX` set pay no extra cost — the same 16 bytes that hold the index pointer hold the original inline nullmap or external pointer, which they would have anyway.
- **Survives copies and slices.**  `ray_alloc_copy` retains the index along with the parent; slicing creates a fresh slice header that doesn't itself carry `HAS_INDEX`, so the slice is index-free until you attach one to it.  The parent and any other holder still see the original index.
- **Dropped, not orphaned, on mutation.**  Indexes are transient by design.  Persistence is intentionally not supported (use `(.col.link)` for persistent column metadata) — `ray_col_save` serializes a clean column with no index, the on-disk format never carries the bit.

## Caveats and Limits

- **Numeric types only (v1).**  The four kinds accept `RAY_BOOL`, `RAY_U8`, `RAY_I16`, `RAY_I32`, `RAY_I64`, `RAY_F32`, `RAY_F64`, `RAY_DATE`, `RAY_TIME`, `RAY_TIMESTAMP`.  `RAY_SYM` / `RAY_STR` are not yet supported — their nullmap-union byte 8–15 collisions with the `sym_dict` / `str_pool` pointers haven't been swept.
- **One slot per column.**  A column carries at most one index kind at a time.  Calling a different kind's attach replaces the existing one.  Multiple indexes per column are deferred — the slot can point to a list-of-indexes in v2 if real workloads want both eq and range fast paths.
- **In-memory only.**  Indexes do not persist across `ray_col_save` / `ray_col_load`; users rebuild explicitly after a load.  Unlike the HNSW handle (see [Vector Search](../graph/vector-search.md)), which has dedicated `hnsw-save` / `hnsw-load` builtins for explicit persistence, `.idx.*` has no on-disk format at all — rebuild is the only option.
- **Float equality not indexed.**  Hash-EQ and hash-IN routes are integer-family only — float equality has NaN / -0 semantics that the unfused compare kernel handles; the index paths intentionally don't replicate that.
- **NE predicates fall back.**  The sort-index range site does not handle NE (two disjoint spans); the scan handles it.
- **Null-bearing columns fall back.**  All new routing paths gate on `HAS_NULLS`; hash-EQ at the filter site also re-checks HAS_NULLS explicitly.  Null-bearing columns never receive index routing in v1.
