# Column Attributes

Semantic properties stamped onto numeric columns — `sorted`, `unique`, `grouped`, `parted`.  Where an [accelerator index](indexes.md) is a *physical* structure (a hash table, a permutation), a column attribute is an *assertion about meaning*: this column is non-descending, these values are distinct.  The `.attr.*` family layers over the same storage as `.idx.*`, but its contract is semantic, not structural.

!!! note "v1 status"
    The four attributes, their strict verify-on-set kernels, and the `(.attr.*)` Rayfall surface are shipped, along with the as-of-join fast paths that consume them.  All attributes are **numeric-only** in v1 — the same numeric type set as `.idx.*`; symbol / string columns are deferred.

## Why Attributes Are Separate from Indexes

An [accelerator index](indexes.md) answers *"what structure is attached?"* — a zonemap, a hash table, a sort permutation.  A column attribute answers a different question: *"what is semantically true of these values?"*  The two markers (`sorted`, `unique`) carry no allocation at all — they are cheap flags.  The two backing-index attributes (`grouped`, `parted`) do reuse the index layer underneath (so a `grouped` or `parted` column also shows up via `.idx.has?` and `.idx.info`), but `.attr.*` exists to assert a *property* the engine can trust, not merely to build a structure.

The payoff is that a consumer — most importantly the [as-of join executor](joins.md#pre-sorted-fast-path) — can trust a stamped attribute unconditionally and skip work it would otherwise have to do defensively.

## The Four Attributes

| Attribute | Category | Asserts | Backing |
|---|---|---|---|
| `sorted` | marker | Values are physically non-descending | None — a cheap flag, no allocation |
| `unique` | marker | All values are distinct | None — a cheap flag, no allocation |
| `grouped` | backing index | value → row-id groups are available | Reuses the hash index |
| `parted` | backing index | Column is laid out as contiguous, ascending value-blocks | Builds a part index (value → `[start, len)` range) |

The two **markers** are independent and may coexist.  A column holds at most **one backing index** at a time: setting `grouped` or `parted` replaces any prior backing index.  Markers may coexist with a backing index.

`parted` is **verify-only** — it never reorders data.  It checks that the column is already block-laid-out (each distinct value occupies one contiguous, ascending run) and errors if it is not.  The caller is responsible for ordering the column first.

## Setting, Reading, and Dropping

### Signatures

`(.attr.set 'name v)   (.attr.get v)   (.attr.drop v)`

- `(.attr.set 'name v)` — assert attribute `name` on numeric vector `v`.  Strict verify: it scans `v` and **errors on violation**, so a stamped attribute never lies.  Returns the column with the attribute recorded.
- `(.attr.get v)` — return the symbol vector of currently-held attributes (the empty symbol vector when none are set).
- `(.attr.drop v)` — remove all attributes from `v`.

### Examples

```lisp
(.attr.get (.attr.set 'sorted [1 2 2 5 9]))                       ; ⇒ ['sorted]
(.attr.get (.attr.set 'unique [1 2 3 4]))                         ; ⇒ ['unique]
(.attr.get (.attr.set 'grouped [1 1 2 3 3]))                      ; ⇒ ['grouped]
(.attr.get (.attr.set 'parted [1 1 1 2 2 3]))                     ; ⇒ ['parted]

; No attributes set — the empty symbol vector.
(.attr.get [1 2 3])

; Drop clears whatever was set.
(.attr.get (.attr.drop (.attr.set 'sorted [1 2 3])))             ; ⇒ no attributes
```

A `sorted` marker works on any numeric column, including temporal types:

```lisp
(.attr.get (.attr.set 'sorted [10:00:01.000 10:00:02.000 10:00:03.000])) ; ⇒ ['sorted]
```

A `parted` column carries a real part index, inspectable through the shared `.idx.*` surface — its `kind` is `part` and `n_parts` is the number of distinct value-blocks:

```lisp
(at (.idx.info (.attr.set 'parted [1 1 2 2])) 'kind)             ; ⇒ 'part
(at (.idx.info (.attr.set 'parted [1 1 2 2])) 'n_parts)          ; ⇒ 2
(.idx.has? (.attr.set 'grouped [1 1 2 3 3]))                      ; ⇒ true
```

Float blocks work too, as long as the layout holds:

```lisp
(.attr.get (.attr.set 'parted [1.0 1.0 2.0]))                    ; ⇒ ['parted]
```

## Strict Verify on Set

`.attr.set` is a *checked assertion*, not a hint.  It scans the column and errors if the property does not hold — so any consumer downstream can trust the stamp without re-verifying.

```lisp
(.attr.set 'sorted [3 1 2])     ; ⇒ error (domain): not non-descending
(.attr.set 'unique [1 2 2 4])   ; ⇒ error (domain): duplicate
(.attr.set 'parted [1 2 1 2])   ; ⇒ error (domain): not block-laid-out
```

An unknown attribute name is rejected the same way:

```lisp
(.attr.set 'bogus [1 2 3])      ; ⇒ error (domain): unknown attribute
```

Setting `sorted` runs an O(n) ascending scan; `unique` and `grouped` build / consult the hash to detect duplicates; `parted` walks the column verifying that each distinct value forms one contiguous ascending block.

## Combining Attributes

The two markers are independent and stack:

```lisp
; markers coexist
(.attr.get (.attr.set 'unique (.attr.set 'sorted [1 2 3])))       ; ⇒ ['sorted 'unique]
```

A marker may also coexist with a backing index:

```lisp
(.attr.get (.attr.set 'unique (.attr.set 'grouped [1 2 3 4])))    ; ⇒ ['unique 'grouped]
```

But a column holds at most one backing index — setting `grouped` or `parted` replaces whichever was there before.

## Conservative Propagation

Attributes propagate **conservatively**.  Only operations that trivially preserve the values — a refcount / copy-on-write copy, a plain rebind — keep the attributes.  *Any* transform that could change ordering, length, or values (arithmetic, `filter` / `where`, `reverse`, `concat`, reordering `take`) **drops** them.  This keeps the invariant honest: a held attribute always reflects the current bytes.

```lisp
; Arithmetic drops the marker (and a backing index).
(.attr.get (+ (.attr.set 'sorted [1 2 3]) 1))                    ; ⇒ no attributes
(.idx.has? (+ (.attr.set 'grouped [1 2 3]) 1))                   ; ⇒ false

; Reorder / concat drop the marker.
(.attr.get (reverse (.attr.set 'sorted [1 2 3])))               ; ⇒ no attributes
(.attr.get (concat (.attr.set 'sorted [1 2 3]) [0 1]))          ; ⇒ no attributes

; Plain rebind preserves.
(set _s (.attr.set 'sorted [1 2 3]))
(.attr.get _s)                                                   ; ⇒ ['sorted]
```

**Re-assert after a transform.**  If you sort, filter, or otherwise rebuild a column and still want the property recognized, call `.attr.set` again on the result.

## The As-of Join Fast Path

The biggest payoff today is in `asof-join` (see [Joins](joins.md#pre-sorted-fast-path)).  The as-of executor would otherwise sort both inputs by `(equality-keys, time)` on every call.  Attributes let it skip that sort when the data already satisfies the required ordering.  These are pure **opt-in acceleration** — when an attribute is present the executor skips a sort; when it is absent it falls back to the usual sort-merge, so results are identical either way.

### Un-partitioned: a lone time key

Equality keys are now **optional**.  A single time key runs an un-partitioned as-of join.  If both time columns carry `sorted`, both sorts are skipped (O(n+m) instead of O(n log n)):

```lisp
(set Lp (table [Time Price] (list [10:00:01.000 10:00:03.000] [100.0 101.0])))
(set Rp (table [Time Bid]   (list [10:00:00.000 10:00:02.000 10:00:04.000] [99.0 100.5 101.5])))
(asof-join [Time] Lp Rp)

; Stamp the marker in place when building the table:
(set Ls (table [Time Price] (list (.attr.set 'sorted [10:00:01.000 10:00:03.000]) [100.0 101.0])))
(.attr.get (at Ls 'Time))                                        ; ⇒ ['sorted]
```

### Partitioned: a `parted` numeric key

For a partitioned join `(asof-join [Key Time] L R)`, if the single numeric equality key is `parted` and its time column is non-descending within each part, that side's sort is skipped.  Note `parted` is **numeric-only** — the equality key here is a numeric ID, not a symbol:

```lisp
(set Lgp (table [ID Time Price]
    (list (.attr.set 'parted [1 1 2 2])
          [10:00:01.000 10:00:03.000 10:00:01.000 10:00:02.000]
          [1.0 2.0 3.0 4.0])))
(asof-join [ID Time] Lgp Rgp)
```

## Caveats and Limits

- **Numeric types only (v1).**  Attributes accept the same numeric type set as `.idx.*` (boolean, integer, float, and temporal types).  Symbol / string columns are deferred — including the `parted` equality key in a partitioned as-of join, which must be a numeric ID.
- **Strict verify, no silent stamping.**  `.attr.set` errors on violation rather than recording a property it cannot confirm; this is what lets consumers trust the stamp unconditionally.
- **Conservative propagation.**  Only copy / rebind preserve attributes; every transform drops them.  Re-assert with `.attr.set` after a transform.
- **One backing index per column.**  `grouped` and `parted` share the [accelerator-index](indexes.md) slot, so a column carries at most one of them at a time; the markers are separate and free.

## Quick Reference

| Function | Syntax | Description |
