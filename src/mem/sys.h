 * Global memory accounting.  Two counters give the true runtime picture:
 *
 *   - "current" (g_sys_current)  — COMMITTED RAM: every anonymous read/write
 *     mapping (buddy pools, sys allocations, the swap-fallback pool).  This is
 *     what actually consumes physical memory.  Progress bar / budget use it.
 *   - "mapped" (g_sys_mapped)    — FILE-BACKED bytes mapped (columns, symbol
 *     file, CSV parse buffers).  Page-cache, evictable, RAM only on touch —
 *     kept separate so a read-once 100 GB column can't masquerade as live RAM.
 *
 * The low-level VM wrappers (ray_vm_alloc / _aligned / _free / _map_file /
 * _unmap_file) and the one raw-mmap site (heap swap fallback) call these so
 * every mapping is counted exactly once.  Bytes are the mapped length; add and
 * sub must balance (same length in as out).
